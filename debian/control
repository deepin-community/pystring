Description: collection of C++ functions for Python's string class methods - runtime
 Pystring is a collection of C++ functions which match the interface
 and behavior of Python's string class methods using std::string.
 Implemented in C++, it does not require or make use of a Python
 interpreter. It provides convenience and familiarity for common
 string operations not included in the standard C++ library.
 It's also useful in environments where both C++ and Python are used.
 .
 Overlapping functionality (such as index and slice/substr) of
 std::string is included to match Python interfaces.
 .
 This package provides the shared libraries.
